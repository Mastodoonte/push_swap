## 👀 Preview
This project asked us to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, in as few moves as possible. To succeed, you had to manipulate different sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for an optimized sorting of the data.

## 👀 Objectives
Writing a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a developer’s journey. It is often the first encounter with the concept of complexity.
Sorting algorithms and their complexity are part of the classic questions discussed during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts since you’ll have to face them at some point.
The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C, and use of basic algorithms. Especially focusing on their complexity.
Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. Especially because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting solution can differ.

## 👀 Rules
• Your project must be written in C.

• Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there is a norm error inside.

• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.

• All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks will be tolerated.

• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

• Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.

• To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile, which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.

• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project’s Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

• We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

• Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git reposi- tory will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.
